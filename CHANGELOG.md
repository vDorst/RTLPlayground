# Change Log

## [0.x] - 2026-xx-XX

## Added

- Web UI
  - Compress the embedded assets (minify + gzip) and switch to a single-page layout. #315
  - Replace the multi-page UI with a themed single-page app: light, dark and Selenized themes following the browser by default,
    English, Japanese and Chinese, save to flash merges the command log into the startup config and verifies the write,
    firmware images are checked in the browser before upload. #429

## Changed

## Fixed

- Config
  - A startup configuration line longer than the command buffer no longer stops the replay:
    the offending line is skipped and the following lines are still applied.
  - The web UI and the configuration upload now refuse a line the replay cannot take,
    instead of writing it to flash.

## Breaking changes

- Config
  - VLAN don't accept port `u`-suffix anymore.
    So `vlan 1 4u` is not valid anymore.
    Replace it with `vlan 1 4`.
- Commands
  - port zero/`0` is treated as the `CPU_PORT`. #326
  - Many commands don't accept the CPU_PORT anymore. See #334.
    When the CPU_PORT is needed, the command/service will add the CPU_PORT automaticly.
    Only `isolate` accept the CPU_PORT as destination port.
