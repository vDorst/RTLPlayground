## Breaking changes

- Config
  - VLAN don't accept port `u`-suffix anymore.
    So `vlan 1 4u` is not valid anymore.
    Replace it with `vlan 1 4`.
- Commands
  - port zero/`0` is treated as the `CPU_PORT`. #326
  - Many commands don't accept the CPU_PORT anymore. See #334.
    When the CPU_PORT is needed, the command/service will add the CPU_PORT automaticly.
    Only `isolate` accept the CPU_PORT as destination port.
