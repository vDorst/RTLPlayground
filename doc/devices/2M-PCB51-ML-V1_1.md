> [!CAUTION]
> This device operates on mains voltage, which can be a dangerous or potentially lethal hazard. Even after the device is unplugged, high-voltage capacitors can remain charged afterward and may still shock you. Do not attempt to open/disassemble a mains powered device unless you understand how to do so safely. Also, opening the device may void your warranty.

## Notes

The stock firmware blinks both the 2.5G and 1G LEDs on activity, despite the front of the device indicating that each LED should be independent. The `POE_2G080110GS` machine config behaves as the front of the device indicates (and what seems more logical) -- each port LED turns on and blinks independently.
